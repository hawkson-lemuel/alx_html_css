            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Lemuel. I am passionate about web development and love creating beautiful and functional websites. This portfolio showcases some of my recent work and projects.</p>

            <h2>My Projects</h2>
            <p>I have worked on several projects ranging from small personal websites to larger, more complex web applications. Each project has helped me grow as a developer and has taught me valuable skills in coding, design, and problem-solving.</p>

            <h3>Project 1: Personal Blog</h3>
            <p>This project is a personal blog where I share my thoughts on web development, technology, and other topics of interest. It features a clean, responsive design and allows visitors to leave comments on my posts.</p>

            <h3>Project 2: E-commerce Site</h3>
            <p>I developed an e-commerce site for a local business, which includes features such as product listings, a shopping cart, and a secure checkout process. This project involved working with various web technologies and frameworks.</p>
